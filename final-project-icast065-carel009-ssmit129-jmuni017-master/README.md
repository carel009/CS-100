 > You will be forming a group of **FOUR** students and working on an interesting project. The project has 4 phases, each one with specific requirements. A list of proposed project ideas that have been successful in previous quarters is listed in the project specifications document on Canvas. You can select an idea from the list, start thinking about the features you will implement, what design patterns can help you implement them, and why. If you want to propose your own original idea, you will have to contact an instructor to discuss the project and obtain written permission before you submit your project proposal (Phase 1). Your project needs to implement at least one design pattern iteratively, which you will have to justify in later phases.The project work should be divided almost equally among team members. You can of course help each other, but it needs to be clear who will be responsible for which features. Additionally, you are expected to follow Scrum patterns, specifically the use of a Scrum (Project) board, Sprints, and Scrum meetings. While Daily Scrums are not required we highly encourage you to practice them.

 
 > ## Expectations
 > * Incorporate **at least one** design pattern
 >   * It is recommended that you include a design pattern that we will teach this session (Composite, Strategy, or Visitor)
 > * Your project should be implemented in C++. If you wish to choose anoher programming language (e.g. Java, Python), please discuss with your lab TA to obtain permission.
 > * You can incorporate additional technologies/tools but they must be approved (in writing) by the instructor or the TA.
 > * Each member of the group **must** be committing code regularly and make sure their code is correctly attributed to them. We will be checking attributions to determine if there was equal contribution to the project.
 > * Each member of the group must actively participate in the Github Project board and reviewing commited code.
> * All project phases are to be submitted to this GitHub repository. You should modify this README file to reflect the different phases of the project. In addition, you should regularly hold sprint meetings with your group. You will need to hold two scrum/check-in meetings with your lab TA/reader in two different weeks in addition to the final demo.


## Project Description
 > Your project description should summarize the project you are proposing. Be sure to include:
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?
 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
 >   * [toolname](link) - Short description
 > * What will be the input/output of your project? What are the features that the project provides?
 > 
 > This description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted. 

 Description: 
 
 Why is it important or intresting to you? 

Dungeon and Dragons is a very interesting board game that anyone can play. However, a notice issue commonly highlighted by the community of DnD enjoyers is that the board game itself is no more then just a board game. There is no video game adaptation of the board game which leave many fans disappointed. Creating a video game based of an infamous board game would be a step in the right direction to expanding the franchise. As a result we are going to adapt the campaign Challenge of the Frog Idol into a text RPG. This is going to include a character selection, a turn-based combat, decision making, enemies with their own stats, all while adapting it to be playable as a game.

What language/tools/technologies do you plan to use? The program is going to be written in C++. Some tools we are planning to use include

  * JPG to ASCII Converter
 
  * [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
  
  * Ubuntu For Desktop
  
  * Visual Studio
	
What will be the input/output of your project? What are the features that the project provides?

The input is going to be the keyboard, where the user is going to be able to type a response to a prompt(Ex: Press 1 for attack). The output is going to be a terminal, where the user gets feedback from their decisions. The project is going to feature turn-based combat, decision making, player stats, enemy stats, items. More feature will be added if time allows. 

> 
 > You also need to set up an empty project board by choosing the  “Automated kanban with review” option on Github. You should also have a Backlog and In testing columns added.
 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature and each design pattern and assign them to the appropriate team member. Place these in the `Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Create smaller actionable development tasks as issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team, taking you until your first meeting with the TA
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 8. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members

## Class Diagram
![class diagram](https://github.com/cs100/final-project-icast065-carel009-ssmit129-jmuni017/blob/master/uml/v3.drawio.png?raw=true)
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).

Instance: This class is going to manage the saving system of the game. As soon as the player starts the game, they will be greeted with a menu and then a scene. Within the scene/menu players should be able to save the game. Each save is associated with an ID.

Scene: The scene class will manage the diffrent scenes a player will encounter. Primairly they will either get a battle scene or a dialougue scene. This is determined by the state of the game, wheter they are in battle or a cutscene.

Character: The character class manages all character type objects including the main character. Each character is either going to be a player, an ally, or a foe. Each character has their own unique stats.

Equipment: The equipment class will manage all item types, such as potions, armor, weapons, or any other consumable items along with key items (non consumable)

Menu: The menu class will contain the needed menus. This includes both a start menu and a main menu. Will also include the combat menu.
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with a reader (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 but NOT during lab time.
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also update this README file by adding the following:
 >   * What design pattern(s) did you use? For each pattern you must explain in 4-5 sentences:
 >     * Why did you pick this pattern? And what feature did you implement with it?
 >     * How did the design pattern help you write better code?
 >   * An updated class diagram that reflects the design pattern(s) you used. You may combine multiple design patterns into one diagram if you'd like, but it needs to be clear which portion of the diagram represents which design pattern (either in the diagram or in the description).
 >   * Make sure your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

Design Pattern(s) used:
Composite - This design pattern seems to be the best option when dealing with character creation.
	    The reason being that the composite design pattern allows for adding aditional components in a straightforward manner.
	    In the case of character creation all 3 character types have the same functions for the most part, which this design pattern allows for easier integration.
	    This design pattern helped me write better code because it allowed me to define character hierarchies and create characters according to their hierarchies.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA/reader during lab time. The TA/reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.

 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 
 There are two ways to Install this program. As of now Linux or MacOs are the only operating systems that are compatible.
Note: For both methods you need cmake. To install use:

```sh
brew install cmake
```
You must do this prior to installing the program.

##Option 1: Using Git

1. Open a terminal window on your system
2. Use `cd [preferable director]` to go to where you want to install it.
3. Type in the following command

```sh
Git Clone https://github.com/cs100/final-project-icast065-carel009-ssmit129-jmuni017.git
```

4. Then type in the next 2 commands

```sh
cmake CMakeListsts.txt
make
```

5. Then run the code with the following command

```sh
./Challenge_of_The_Idol_Frog
```

Or you can double click the file "Challenge_of_The_Idol_Frog" in your install directory.


##Option 2: Download release files
1. Download the zip in the release file
2. Extract your prefered directory and run the following commands

```sh
cmake CMakeListsts.txt
make
./Challenge_of_The_Idol_Frog
```

Or just double click "Challenge_of_The_Idol_Frog"





 ## Testing
 Character Creation Testing: Testing for character creation has been done by creating unit tests on gtest.
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
